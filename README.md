# Lineage

## 4. Orange Manufacturing Group and Kurtis Stirling (2025)
We needed a free and open source font for the Bitcoin Knots project, so made this ourselves. See below of previous manufacturers of OCR-B fonts and their statements on copyright and licensing.

*What we've done so far:*
* redraw of all glyphs from scratch, polishing and optimising paths in the process
* added MIT licence to metadata
* added hexadecimal Tonals
* replaced ü™¢ with Knots logo
* added ‚Çø symbol
* added sats symbol


*To Do:*
* Reduce letter spacing by 10%
* widen thin letters (c, r, t, f, h, x etc) so less gap when they are near each other, reducing the need for kerning (don't want to do that - want to retain monospacing)
* ,.;: etc make thinner... they are still a bit thick, but still a lot better visually than previous versions
* * reduce size of numbers
* add left and right arrows (now ‚Üê ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üì all exist)
* update knots logo to new version 


## 3. Matthew Skala (2011)
"I make no copyright claim on these fonts myself. I do not believe anyone else makes a copyright claim that would conflict with the use of these fonts in a commercial project, but I cannot speak for any party other than myself."

## 2. Norbert Schwarz (1986)
"As far as the digitization in METAFONT input which I have developed, you may freely use, modify, and/or distribute any of these files or the resulting fonts, without limitation. A previous release of ocr-b only granted rights for non-commercial use; that restriction is now lifted."

## 1. Adrian Frutiger (1968)
The original OCR-B font was design by Adrian for Monotype, to meet the standards of the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and later adopted as the ISO 1073-2:1976 (E) standard. However, specific details about the initial license terms applied by Frutiger or Monotype are not explicitly documented in publicly available sources.
